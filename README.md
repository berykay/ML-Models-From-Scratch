# Machine Learning Models from Scratch

Welcome to the Machine Learning Models from Scratch repository! This repository contains Python implementations of three fundamental machine learning algorithms: Decision Tree, K-Means Clustering, and Linear Regression. Each of these algorithms is implemented from scratch without using any external libraries except for the `random` and `math` libraries. Additionally, there are small projects included to showcase the usage of these models.

## Decision Tree

The Decision Tree model is a versatile machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. In this implementation, we have created a Decision Tree classifier/regressor from scratch using Python.

## K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for data clustering and segmentation. In this implementation, we have created a K-Means Clustering algorithm from scratch using Python.

## Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable. In this implementation, we have created a Linear Regression model from scratch using Python.

## Projects

We have included small projects that demonstrate the usage of these machine learning models:

1. **Iris Flower Classification with Decision Tree:** A project that uses the Decision Tree model to classify Iris flowers into different species.

    - [Iris Flower Classification Project](Decision_Tree/report.ipynb)

2. **Iris Flower Classification with K-Means Clustering:** A project that uses K-Means Clustering to classify Iris flowers into different species.

    - [Iris Flower Classification Project](K_Means_Clustering/report.ipynb)

3. **500 Person Gender-Height-Weight-Body Mass Index with Linear Regression:** A project that uses Linear Regression to predict Body Mass Index (BMI) based on features like gender, height, and weight for a dataset of 500 individuals.

## Getting Started

To get started with these machine learning models and projects, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/berykay/ML-Models-From-Scratch

2.Navigate to the relevant model or project directory.

3.Run the Python script associated with the model or project.

## Usage

Each model and project has its own Python script that you can run to see the model in action. The scripts are well-documented, and you can easily customize them for your own datasets or use cases.

##

I hope you find these machine learning models and projects helpful for your understanding of the algorithms and their practical applications. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or reach out to us.

Happy coding!
